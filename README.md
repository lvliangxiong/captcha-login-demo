# captcha-login-demo

A small demo of login with captcha validation.

## Usage

1. run the user.sql file in mysql
2. modify the application.properties to accommodate your database settings
3. deploy this project to the Tomcat server
4. test as you want

By default, two users with (test, test), (JOEY, EVELYN) as username and password respectively are reserved.

This demo doesn't provide register functionality, if you want to create you own user, manipulate the database directly.
